        <p>    From the wally movie comes the prequel of Eve. Eli is the twin robot for the famous Eve. Her name stands for Extra-Terrestial Life Incinirator. You never knew she existed because Eve hogged all of the screen time. As Eli was created first and when even was created they were close friends until Eli was sent to earth to see if it was inhabitable and to kill of foreign life to become Christofer Columbus 2.0 She and Eve had beef because Eli meet Wally first and then she stole Wall.Then Eve shows up and found the plant in the boot she kept it hidden knowing that Eli would try to kill it. Our poor dear eli ended up as a pile of scraps after she almost incinarated Eve.</p>
