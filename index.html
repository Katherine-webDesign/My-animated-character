        <p>    From the wally movie comes the prequel of Eve. Elix is the twin robot for the famous Eve. Her name stands for Extra-Terrestial Life Incinirator. You never knew she existed because Eve hogged all of the screen time. As Elix was created first and when even was created they were close friends until Eli was sent to earth to see if it was inhabitable and to kill of foreign life.. She and Eve had beef because Elix meet Wally first but she couldn't go back to the ship and became scraps.Then Eve shows up and found the plant in the boot she kept it hidden knowing that Eli would try to kill it. </p>
